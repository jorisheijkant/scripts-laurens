# Scraping and LLM scripts

As part of a quick crash course in web scraping, python and local LLM's I wrote a bunch of scripts that show the basic concepts in python.

They both come in notebook form and raw python (see their respective folders) but the content is the exact same.

## Prerequisites

All scripts can be ran with a modern version of Python. The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Preferably use a virtual environment for this, especially for the playwright stuff.
